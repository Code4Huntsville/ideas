There are examples of some really good parking apps in other cities. Low hanging fruit would be an app that identifies
the free and paid lots, with a bit of transactional databasing these parking lot could have real-time or near real-time 
capcity indicators so users have a good sense of which lots to drive to. 

The more useful and harder application could identify empty space for on stree parking and even include a revervation 
system within a short temporal window. But the hard nuts to crack are developing, specifing and building meter heads or 
some sort of sensors that could be glued to the pavement. There are RFID sensors but they don't transmit that far... 
making a meter head could be expensive. So there are some real engineering challenges here but worth trying to do. 

The incentive for the city would be capture true real-time demand pricing. The city could be making money from this
app. Unfortunatly the mayor will show resistance until hard a business plan, or proforma that showes the ROI, is
presented. But we should be talking about this application as it would make us famous.
