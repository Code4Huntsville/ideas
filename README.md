# Ideas - A Projects Leader Board

This is the **The Ideas Board** - place to list project ideas, and to help refine the goals or functionality of proposed projects.

Perhaps following this [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlrJVSJRUN4)
or check out this example of how the [OpenOakland Brigade](https://github.com/openoakland/ideas) uses the issues section

**Advantages:**
* There is an API
* They have an iphone app
* They have a lower learning curve than editing a git repo.

For those who want to put a little pizazz in the way it looks here is a [guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to GitHub's markdown (as apose to markup?) syntax
