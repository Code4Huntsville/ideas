# Projects Leader Board

This is the **Projects Leader Board** - place to list project ideas, and to help refine the goals or functionality of proposed projects.

Anyone can add a file to this repository (click the plus sign at the end of the "project_leader_board" above). Once the file 
created write a description of your idea. Try to be as specific as possible. 

You can also add to an exisitng file by selecting it and then simply edit. (be respectful of other people's work and thoughts)

If a member or a team sees a project here that they want to work on create a new repository, and make a note of the new repository name in the text file here.

When starting a new project, particulaly if it involved an app that may be ful use to local government besure to check in with the Municipal Partner. They may try and arrange a time and place where you can get together with the intending users to develop and design a functional specification. There is no requirement to have a functional specification but it is hightly recommended if you intend for other to use your application.
