Setting up and populating our own online (cloud based) data repository. That has APIs and bulk loading interfaces. We need to
do this for three reasons.

1. Caching data from databases that have low transactional activity will help offload server demand from city systems

2. We can build multi-jurisdictional system that provides data from several local governments, Madison City, Madison County,
   Athens, Decatur, Limestone County etc. 

3. Controlling the importing of datasets we can build toward datasets that can be compared between the jurisdictions.

I believe we have a tool that will help us do this.
