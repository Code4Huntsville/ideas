The Huntsville Animal Shelter information and lost pet alert app.

The Huntsville Animal Shelter could possible use a tablet and browser-based application that:
.  Allowed animal control officers to easily add information and photos of animals being processed into the shelter

.  The information would be part of a database that was accessed by mobile devices and desktop browsers that would have 
   sorting and filter algorithms so that anyone looking for a lost pet could use an intuitive search process

.  Citizens could also enter details about lost pets, breed, color, size and photos that would be access by animal 
   control officers are the time of the encounter such that if the animal could be identified it could be returned 
   to the owner without having to process the animal into the shelter.
