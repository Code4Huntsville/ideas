I think the SeeClickFix (locally HSVConnect) is a great app except... we need to extend it so that a citizen can
take a photo or report a problem by smart phone from any location in the metro area where the event it sent to a central 
server that sorts out which jurisdiction owns the problem. And it needs a broad set of categories beyond just problems 
traffic and vehicular road ways... Events may include other information that the citizens would like to layer on to maps 
and have a dialog about.

On the flip side, the application should be tied to and interface with work order and task management systems such that 
the public can see when a certain problems or event are going to be address in mid-range and short-range time frames. i.e. 
crews are working on problem x and location y now, today, tomorrow next Monday... Making the Work order and task management
transparent has the added advantage of allowing other agencies, e.g. Huntsville Utilities to see paving schedules etc. 
solving the age old problem of one group digging up pavement and resurfacing only to have another agency come in a month later
to dig up the same spot for a different reason.
