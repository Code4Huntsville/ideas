 An app for the Big Picture Huntsville process that let people tag location with smartphone and add notes
 e.g. "I wish this empty strip mall could be used for..." Or 
 "this corner would be a great place for a bus stop and coffee shop".
 
 While this application seems like it might be quite a bit like the SeeClickFix app it might be different depending
 on how city planners envision it... worth exploring a bit more. We would need more input from Dennis Madsen on his
 ideas here.
 
 See, See ClickFixExtensionApp. This project may overlap with and could be combined with that app.
